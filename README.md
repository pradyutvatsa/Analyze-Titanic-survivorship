# Analyze-Titanic-survivorship
This is a data analysis project. I need to take a look at the dataset and suggest what questions I could answer using that dataset. It will not require machine learning. 
Use Pandas and NumPy's wherever possible
Conduct statistical tests wherever possible
There is no one right answer and is open-ended. 

Pick up the titanic survivorship data. It contains demographic information from 891 of 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. 

Analyze the data: 

Ask a set of questions and proceed to answer them, even if tentatively to analyze the data
Report your findings. 
Get your project submission reviewed.
